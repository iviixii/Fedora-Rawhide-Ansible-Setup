# Fedora-Rawhide-Ansible-Setup

Fedora Rawhide is awesome but it needs to be tamed. Sometimes an update can go south real quick. In that case, this ansible script is here to help get myself up and running in as few as time as possible on a fresh install.

## How to Run.
> The `-K` enables root access you will be prompted for root password
* `ansible-playbook -K gunsmoke.yml`
